#>>>>> Protected Properties <<<<<#
'''Python also has a convention for protected properties using a single underscore _ prefix:'''

class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, salary):
    self.name = name
    self._salary = salary # Protected property

p1 = Person("Linus", 50000)
print(p1.name)
print(p1._salary) # Can access, but shouldn't

'''
Note: A single underscore _ is just a convention. It tells other programmers that 
the property is intended for internal use, but Python doesn't enforce this restriction.
