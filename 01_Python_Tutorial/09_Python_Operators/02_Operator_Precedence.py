''' Parentheses has the highest precedence, 
meaning that expressions inside parentheses 
must be evaluated first: '''
print((6 + 3) - (6 + 3)) # Output: 0

''' Multiplication * has higher precedence than 
addition +, and therefore multiplications are 
evaluated before additions: '''
print(100 + 5 * 3) # Output: 115

''' Addition + and subtraction - has the same precedence, 
and therefore we evaluate the expression from left to right: '''
print(5 + 4 - 7 + 3) # Output: 5
